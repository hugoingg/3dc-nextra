Blockchain is a technology that you cannot explain it in any way without some kind of technical term (buzzword) that gets in the way of understanding it. Thus, the workshop is structured into getting students blockchain conversant and finally confident.

The syllabus of the course is designed to guide students who are an absolute beginner in blockchain technology to be able to work with smart contracts.

When they complete this course, there is an avenue for them to apply their knowledge with OpenNodes Campus Collective. This will grant them more opportunities to scope and create their own activities together with the Campus Lead of SUTD.

The content of the workshop and the network is provided by the OpenNodes Campus Collective. 

### Learning Objectives

At the end of this workshop, students should be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts of Blockchain Technology 
- Apply the ‘should you use a blockchain flowchart’
- Tie in the concepts taught with specific use cases
- Read academic papers, Etherum brown papers or blog teardowns of Ethereum’s and bitcoin’s papers 
- Use design thinking on blockchain use cases
- Understand what is termed as ‘Tokenomics’
- Use Remix to deploy existing smart contracts
-	Use Ganache to run smart contracts locally
- Program in Solidity 
- Connect smart contracts with a front-end

### Lesson Plan 

#### Day 1

- Introduction to Concepts in Blockchain: Aims at making students Blockchain conversant to be able to understand the underlying concepts so that they can be able to critically read and teardown articles
- Blockchain in the Industry: Aims at equipping students with enough knowledge and skill to be able to be able to use the principles and concepts that they learnt to identify and come up with potential Blockchain use cases in the industry
- Industry Leader Seminar 1


#### Day 2
- Introduction to Smart Contracts: Aims at giving students the ability to look at Blockchain from a technical perspective and giving them sufficient knowledge about Smart Contracts and Solidity for them to be able to adapt sample smart contracts for specific use cases.
- Being the Blockchain Developer: Ends off the series with a segment on being able to write Smart Contracts from scratch, being able to connect their smart contract to a front-end webpage
- Industry Leader Seminar 2
